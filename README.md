Welcome to the Community Careers repository! 

This is an open source project that aims to create a simple and easy-to-use job listing platform for niche communities. Our goal is to connect local job seekers with job openings in their area, and to help businesses find the right talent for their needs. 

The website is built with Javascript and React. We welcome contributions from the community and encourage you to fork the repository and submit pull requests. 

If you have any questions or ideas for improving the project, please open an issue.
